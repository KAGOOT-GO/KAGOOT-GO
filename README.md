- 👋 Hi, I’m Tom @ KAGOOT-GO
- 👀 I’m interested in automating the processes of businesses in an all inclusive manner, main focus starting is in the crypto space and am the team leader responsible for the KAGOOT-GO software idea. The concept prototype software will combine system dynamics and transaction process automation within a blockchain transparency.   
- 🌱 I’m currently learning everything, sorry just I very often feel I don't know anything. Looking for team players to join in my project who are github project capable towards getting this done and entering the crypto exchange / crypto transaction space.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on the finer aspects of software programming languages, what will work for business owners in the real world and what won't and how to know in advance of launch, what business owners will be willing to pay, the software business its self.  
- 📫 How to reach me. Please feel free to reach out to me on here, (if there is a way of doing it on here, I don't know if there is) or you can also reach me at my projects email which is      rawcab.webstarts.com@gmail.com
