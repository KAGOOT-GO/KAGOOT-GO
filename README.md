- 👋 Hi, I’m Tom @ KAGOOT-GO
- 👀 I’m interested in automating the processes of businesses in an all inclusive manner, main focus starting is in the crypto space and am the team leader responsible for the KAGOOT-GO software idea. The concept prototype software will combine system dynamics and transaction process automation within a new blockchain transparency.   
- 🌱 I’m currently learning everything, sorry just I very often feel I don't know anything. Looking for team players to join in my project who are github project capable towards building a new blockchain that supports a new native coin and getting this done by entering the crypto exchange / crypto transaction space.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with developers on the finer aspects of the best blockchain development software programming languages, what will work and what won't and how to know in advance of a future launch, what the outcome will be and what it will cost.  
- 📫 How to reach me. Please feel free to reach out to me on here, (if there is a way of doing it on here, I don't know if there is) or you can also reach me at my projects email which is KAGOOT-GO@mail.com
